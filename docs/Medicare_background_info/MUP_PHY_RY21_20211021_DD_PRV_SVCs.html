deductible and coinsurance amounts have been deducted<br>
for the line item service and after standardization of the<br>

removes geographic differences in payment rates for<br>
individual services, such as those that account for local<br>

wages or input prices and makes Medicare payments across<br>
Payment Amount<br>
Avg_Mdcr_Stdzd_Amt<br>
geographic areas comparable, so that differences reflect<br>
variation in factors such as physicians' practice patterns and<br>
beneficiaries' ability and wil ingness to obtain care. Note:<br>

2014 data. Please refer to the "Additional Information"<br>
